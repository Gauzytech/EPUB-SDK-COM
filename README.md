We are a company specializing in the development of EPUB readers. Our product is called Neat Reader. You can search it on Google and experience it. At present, we are planning to extract the private EPUB SDK in Neat Reader and provide it to enterprises in the form of EPUB SDK.

We know that you can find some free or low-priced EPUB SDK, but their actual experience is not satisfactory, and stability is difficult to guarantee. Unfortunately, there is no "high price and high quality" EPUB SDK on the market. So we decided to export the SDK in Neat Reader to the outside world.

At present, the SDK business is still in the preparation stage, and it should be officially released before June 2020. If your business or organization needs high-quality EPUB SDK, please contact us. We will listen to your voice and integrate these needs into the SDK service plan.

我们是一家专注于EPUB阅读器研发的公司，我们的产品叫Neat Reader，您可以在Google上搜索它，并进行体验。目前，我们正在计划将Neat Reader中的私有EPUB SDK进行提取，并以EPUB SDK的形式提供给需要的企业。

我们知道您可以找到一些免费或是低价的EPUB SDK，但是它们的实际体验却差强人意，稳定性也难以保障。可惜目前市场上不存在“高价高质”的EPUB SDK。因此我们决定将Neat Reader中的SDK进行对外输出。

目前SDK业务还处在准备阶段，应该会在2020年6月份之前正式对外发布。如果您的企业或组织需要高质量的EPUB SDK，欢迎与我们联系。我们将倾听您的声音，并把这些需求融入到SDK服务方案中。
