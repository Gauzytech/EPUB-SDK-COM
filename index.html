<p>We are a company specializing in the development of EPUB readers. Our product is called Neat Reader. You can search
    it on Google and experience it. At present, we are planning to extract the private EPUB SDK in Neat Reader and
    provide it to enterprises in the form of EPUB SDK.</p>
<p>We know that you can find some free or low-priced EPUB SDK, but their actual experience is not satisfactory, and
    stability is difficult to guarantee. Unfortunately, there is no "high price and high quality" EPUB SDK on the
    market. So we decided to export the SDK in Neat Reader to the outside world.</p>
<p>
    At present, the SDK business is still in the preparation stage, and it should be officially released before June
    2020. If your business or organization needs high-quality EPUB SDK, please contact us. We will listen to your voice
    and integrate these needs into the SDK service plan.
